# Creating an assistant and configuring conversational search
To create your watsonx Assistant for Z, use [watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?p1=Search&p4=43700077722754881&p5=e&p9=58700008198244496&gad_source=1&gclsrc=ds) to create the assistant and configure conversational search. You can configure your assistant to use conversational search by using a hosted [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) instance. The pre-configured instance in IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) has over 220 knowledge sources and supports Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The large language model (LLM) providing the conversational AI augments this knowledge based on IBM Z documentation. All of these elements create IBM Z context-aware responses to queries with its content-grounded knowledge.

## Configure the base large language model
After the preceding steps are completed, there are enhancements that can be made to configure how the large language model (LLM) responds to your queries. Including adding prompt instructions and configuring the LLMâ€™s answer behavior.
These options can be summarized <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/waz/2.x?topic=assistant-configuring-base-llm" target="_blank">here</a>.

1.  Hover over the **home** (![](_attachments/homeIcon.png)) and click **Generative AI**.
    
    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI1.png)

2.  Click **Add instructions**.

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI2.png)

3.  Enter a **prompt instruction**.

    This option instructs the LLM in your assistant to give refined responses by adding prompt instructions. The instructions help the LLM guide the conversations with clarify and specifically to achieve the end-goal of an action.

    Enter the prompt instructions in the field. The maximum number of characters you can enter in the prompt instruction field is 1,000. 
        
    The following is an example prompt instruction that works well. Experiment with different prompt instructions.

    ```
    You are a subject matter expert on mainframe systems. Please respond to all prompts with truth and accuracy. Keep all answers short and concise, unless requested to provide details.
    ```

    **Note: When the instructions are typed in, they are automatically saved and the LLM is immediately trained on them.**

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI3.png)

4.  Toggle **General-purpose answering** to **off**.

    The ability exists to configure the answering behavior of your assistant to provide responses that are based on the preinstalled content or general content.

    On the **Generative AI** page (under **Prompt Instructions**), you see the **Answer behavior** section. After you configure **Conversational search**, you see that it is enabled (toggled on) with the search integration added.

    If you enable both General-purpose answering as well as Conversational search, the Conversational search answering takes precedence over General-purpose answering. 
    
    **For purposes of retrieving Z-specific answers and responses, it is recommended that you turn off General-purpose answering and leave only Conversational search turned on.**

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI4.png)

## Testing conversational search
Now, you can begin issuing queries to test the assistant's responses.

It is important to keep in mind that many of the settings configured earlier can be iteratively modified based on your assessment of the quality of responses. The settings can be reviewed and changed at any time. For example, adding extra prompt instructions, changing the verbosity of the responses, and modifying the indexes used for OpenSearch.

53. Hover over the **home** (![](_attachments/homeIcon.png)) and click **Preview**.

    ![](_attachments/preview0.png)

54. Experiment with different prompts and validate the answers are reasonable and related to IBM Z.

    Other prompts and responses follow. Note: the responses that you receive can vary from the ones shown.

    **Prompt**: 

    ```
    What is the APF list in z/OS? Provide a detailed explanation?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview1.png)

    **Prompt**:

    ```
    Why is Db2 different than other database systems?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview2.png)

    **Prompt**:

    ```
    What happens during an IPL on IBM Z?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview3.png)

<!-- Should we add a query that will eventually fire a skill off and show that id doesn't do that right now? -->

You now have a working assistant that uses {{offering.name}}. Take time to explore different prompt instructions and settings. If you encounter any issues, the Troubleshooting section that follows can help resolve them.
