# Creating an Assistant & configuring conversational search
This section will cover how to begin using [watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?p1=Search&p4=43700077722754881&p5=e&p9=58700008198244496&gad_source=1&gclsrc=ds) to create a new assistant for watsonx Assistant for Z and configure conversational search. You will be able to configure your assistant to use conversational search using a hosted [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) instance. The pre-configured instance in IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) has over 220 knowledge sources and supports the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in which the Large Language Model (LLM) providing the conversational AI is augmented by this knowledge based on IBM Z documentation. All of which helps create IBM Z context-aware responses to queries with its content-grounded knowledge.

## Configure the base Large Language Model (LLM)
Once the above steps have been completed, there are some final enhancements that can be made to configure how the LLM will respond to your queries. This includes Adding prompt instructions as well as configuring the LLMâ€™s answer behavior.
These options can be summarized <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/waz/2.x?topic=assistant-configuring-base-llm" target="_blank">here</a>.

49. Hover over the **home** (![](_attachments/homeIcon.png)) and click **Generative AI**.
    
    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI1.png)

50. Click **Add instructions**.

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI2.png)

51. Enter a **prompt instruction**.

    This option instructs the LLM in your assistant to give refined responses by adding prompt instructions. The instructions helps the LLM guide the conversations with clarify and specifically to achieve the end-goal of an action.

    Enter the prompt instructions in the field. The maximum number of characters you can enter in the Prompt instruction field is 1,000. 
        
    Below is an example prompt instruction that has worked well. Feel free to explore using your own prompt instructions.

    ```
    You are a subject matter expert on mainframe systems. Please respond to all prompts with truth and accuracy. Keep all answers short and concise, unless requested to provide details.
    ```

    **Note: Once the instructions are typed in, they are automatically saved and the LLM is immediately trained on them.**

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI3.png)

52. Toggle **General-purpose answering** to **off**.

    There is also the ability to configure the answering behavior of your assistant to provide responses that are based on the preloaded content or general content.

    At the bottom of the Generative AI page (under Prompt Instructions), you will see the Answer behavior section. Once youâ€™ve configured Conversational search, you will now see that it is enabled (toggled on) with the search integration you added previously.

    If you enable both General-purpose answering as well as Conversational search, the Conversational search answering takes precedence over General-purpose answering. 
    
    **For purposes of retrieving Z specific answers and responses, it is recommended that you turn off General-purpose answering and only leave Conversational search turned on.**

    ![](_attachments/genAIGenAI4.png)

## Testing conversational search
Now that all of your assistant settings have been made and you have enabled conversational search, you can begin issuing queries to test the responses.

It is important to keep in mind that many of the settings configured above can be iteratively modified based on your assessment of the quality of responses. These can be revisited and changed at any point (for example, adding additional prompt instructions, changing verbosity of the responses, and modifying the indexes used for OpenSearch).

53. Hover over the **home** (![](_attachments/homeIcon.png)) and click **Preview**.

    ![](_attachments/preview0.png)

54. Experiment with different prompts and validate the answers are reasonable and related to IBM Z.

    Here are a few prompts and responses. Note: the responses you receive may vary from those shown below.

    **Prompt**: 

    ```
    What is the APF list in z/OS? Provide a detailed explanation?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview1.png)

    **Prompt**:

    ```
    Why is Db2 different than other database systems?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview2.png)

    **Prompt**:

    ```
    What happens during an IPL on IBM Z?
    ```

    **Example output**:

    ![](_attachments/preview3.png)

<!-- Should we add a query that will eventually fire a skill off and show that id doesn't do that right now? -->

You should now have a working assistant using {{offering.name}}.
