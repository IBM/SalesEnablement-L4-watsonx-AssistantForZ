**IBM technical sellers** must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation checklist in the <a href="{{learningplan.YLurl}}" target="_blank">YourLearning learning plan</a> for the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** must pass the {{learningplan.name}} quiz that is located in the <a href="{{learningplan.BPurl}}" target="_blank">IBM Training learning plan</a>. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and click-through demonstrations, and not one's general knowledge of the offering.
