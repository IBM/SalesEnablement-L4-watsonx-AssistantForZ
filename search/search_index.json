Now that you have your own docs that are ingested for conversational search, you can set the metadata field for your assistant to use those documents in its content-grounded search. If you leave the metadata field empty, then it defaults to settings found to perform well. This replaces having to paste a complicated search string. By default (without any string in the Metadata field), it searches all the default IBM provided documentation and all ingested customer documentation using the following value:</p> <pre><code>{\u201cibm_indices\u201d:\u201c*_ibm_docs_slate\u201d,\n\u201ccustomer_indices\u201d:\u201ccustomer_*\u201d}\n</code></pre> <p>Replacing the wildcard string with an explicit list of indices allows personalization. The metadata setting is where you can input specific indices (pointing to the underlying documentation) that you want your assistant to use for the content-grounded search. Out of the box there are over 220 products and topics that the OpenSearch instance has IBM Documentation for. You can find those indices and products here.</p> <p>You can input a subset of indices into the \u201cMetadata\u201d field in cases where you only want your assistant to gather context for specific IBM products or topics. The specific indices can be listed out in this format:</p> <pre><code>{\u201cibm_indices\u201d:\u201c&lt;comma separated index values&gt;\u201d,\u201ccustomer_indices\u201d:\u201ccustomer_*\u201d}\n</code></pre> <p>For example, if you only want your assistant to reference documentation for \u201cDb2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS\u201d and no ingested client documentation, you can enter the following into the metadata field:</p> <pre><code>{\u201cibm_indices\u201d:\u201css4lq8_ibm_docs_slate\u201d}\n</code></pre> <p>If you have a mix of IBM Documentation and client documentation ingested, then there\u2019s an optional search string that you can use to set the \u201cweights\u201d used for each. </p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>{\"doc_weight\":\n{\"product_docs\":0.5,\n \"customer_docs\":0.5},\n\"ibm_indicies\":\"*_ibm_docs_slate\",\n\"customer_indicies\":\"customer_*\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, \u201cproduct_docs\u201d is the weight that is assigned to \u201cibm_indices\u201d and \u201ccustomer_docs\u201d is the weight that is assigned to \u201ccustomer_indices\u201d.</p> <p>After you have configured all the settings for Conversational Search on the page, click \u201cSave\u201d in the upper-right of the page.</p> <p>For more information on customizing the metadata field for conversational search, refer to this supplemental video found here.</p> <p>You are encouraged to experiment with the metadata field! Try setting the metadata field to the following, which weights ingested docs higher than the product docs:</p> <pre><code>{\"doc_weight\":\n{\"product_docs\":0.2,\n \"customer_docs\":0.8},\n\"ibm_indicies\":\"*_ibm_docs_slate\",\n\"customer_indicies\":\"customer_*\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now, repeat steps 6 through 8. Notice that the ingested Red Piece document is now the first sited reference!</p> <p></p>"}]}
